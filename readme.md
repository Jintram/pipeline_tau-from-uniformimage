# Description

For screening purposes, many samples have been imaged, which are measuring a uniform (cell lysate) lifetime signal. 
The goal of this script is to provide an easy way to convert a set of images to a set of lifetimes.

## Installation / dependencies

This script requires the following libraries to be installed:

```
pandas
skimage
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
adjustText # not essential, only for plotting
```

The script was run on my computer using the environment `2024_FLIM`, which can also be installed completely by downloading and installing the appropriate conda environment using my repository with [conda environments](https://github.com/Jintram/conda-environments).
